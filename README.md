> Configure TTS parameters such as language, voice, and playback options.
4. **API Integration:**
> Utilize joke APIs (e.g., JokeAPI, Official Joke API) to fetch jokes from various categories.
> Parse the JSON response from the API to extract joke content and handle any errors or edge cases.
5. **User Interaction:**
> Implement event listeners to handle button clicks and trigger the joke retrieval process.
> Provide visual feedback to users during the joke retrieval process (e.g., loading spinner, disabled button).
6. **Error Handling:**
> Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle API errors, network issues, and other potential failure scenarios.
> Display informative error messages to users and log errors for troubleshooting purposes.
7. **Testing and Refinement:**
> Test the application across different web browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
> Gather user feedback and make refinements to improve the user experience and address any usability issues.
8. **Deployment:**
> Deploy the application to a web hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Heroku) to make it accessible to users over the internet.

By following these implementation steps, you can create a functional and engaging "Joke Teller" application that brings laughter and entertainment to users worldwide.
